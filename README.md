# altium_lib
This is the common or frequently used Altium Components Library for Electronics amateur.

It contains some old components footprints such as BJT TOP92 package etc.

I hope sharing this library can reduce the time used in develop frequently used Altium components in amateur projects.

Any idea and comments are welcome. Enjoy it!
